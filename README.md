This is a very simple rendition of a flawed game that runs in the browser. I made it reasonably pretty, all things considered. 

To run it, simply have the files in the same folder and open index.html with your favorite Browser.
If your favorite Browser is an ancient version of Internet Explorer, you must reassess your life choices first.
For it to work perfectly, make sure you have an active internet connection while running, as the Font is pulled from Google.
